## Flappy Bird Game

This repository contains a simple Flappy Bird clone written in Python.  The game
uses PyOpenGL to render a larger 3â€‘D scene with increased screen resolution.
The bird has basic wing animation. If a file named `hit.wav` is placed
alongside `flappy.py`, a short sound effect will play whenever the bird
collides with a pipe or the ground.

### Requirements
- Python 3
- pygame
- PyOpenGL
- PyOpenGL\_accelerate

### Running the game
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python flappy.py
   ```
